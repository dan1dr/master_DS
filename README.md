# Master in Data Science
This is my repository for the Master in Data Science taught at KSchool, divided by topics lectured in the course â€” from scratch in Python to some more advanced libraries and tools. 

It will be kept updated along the process, so hope you find it useful! :kissing_smiling_eyes:
